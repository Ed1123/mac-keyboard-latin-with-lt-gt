# Mac Latin Keyboard with <> symbols
This is just the latin keyboard layout I used for my Mac with an English physical keyboard. It has one less key than a regular Latin keyboard, the <> one, so if I want to use the Latin layout I've used all my life I won't be able to code.

## Installation instructions
```console
git clone https://github.com/Ed1123/mac-keyboard-latin-with-lt-gt.git
sudo cp mac-keyboard-latin-with-lt-gt/LatinWith<>.bundle /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts
```
Logout and apply the new keyboard. It should be under Spanish layouts.
